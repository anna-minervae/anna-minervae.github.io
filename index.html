                <p class="flexSection">
                    <span class="subsectionText">During a course in the Spring 2025 semester, I wrote several papers concerning the applications of LLMs 
                        for programming, and the benefits and concerns associated with such. One of these papers involved a comparison between password generators written in Python by a human (myself),
                        ChatGPT, and the coding-oriented AI Zencoder. I am currently working on expanding and publicizing this research.</span>

                    <span class="subsectionText">Devotio is a personal passion project. A video game set in Ancient Rome, it explores the Roman culture and mythology in a 2D side-scroller format. I am working on this independently and created all assets myself. Ideally, I would like the whole game to be dubbed in Latin. During an independent study, I developed a demo using Unity; I may use the Unreal Engine in future.</span>

                <h3>FireWatch - Spring 2023</h3>

                    <span class="subsectionText">FireWatch was an application I created for my Environmental Science class in my junior year of high school. I designed a bushfire simulation based on various scientific studies. 
                        Made in C# with the Unity game engine, FireWatch works on a tile system. Each tile has both a vegetation property and an elevation property. By analyzing each tile's properties, 
                        the algorithm creates a visual prediction of the bushfire's behavior. I was inspired by my Australian heritage, and I hope to refine this one day.
