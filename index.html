                    <span class="projectDesc">Devotio is a personal passion project. A video game set in Ancient Rome, it explores the Roman culture and mythology in a 2D side-scroller format. I am working on this independently and created all assets myself. Ideally, I would like the whole game to be dubbed in Latin. During an independent study, I developed a demo using Unity; I may use the Unreal Engine in future.</span>

                    <span class="projectDesc">FireWatch was an application I created for my Environmental Science class in my junior year of high school. I designed a bushfire simulation based on various scientific studies. Made in C# with the Unity game engine, FireWatch works on a tile system. Each tile has both a vegetation property and an elevation property. By analyzing each tile's properties, the algorithm creates a visual prediction of the bushfire's behavior. I was inspired by my Australian heritage, and I hope to refine this one day.</span>
